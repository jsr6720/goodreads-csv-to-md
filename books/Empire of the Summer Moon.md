### My Review
Definitely worth the read of "things they don't teach in high school". An amazing look at the high plains tribes of Texas/Mexico/Oklahoma and all the challenges there within.<br/><br/>Amazing to think that the Comanche bands had stopped and pushed back westward anglo settlers for decades before the advent of modern day repeating rifles and disease. Great segue for [b:Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|1842|Guns, Germs, and Steel  The Fates of Human Societies|Jared Diamond|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453215833l/1842._SY75_.jpg|2138852]
