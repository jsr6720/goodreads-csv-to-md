### My Review
I thought this book was a lot of fun, but there were moments of intense description that have nothing to do with being a parent, but more to do with becoming a mother.<br/><br/>If I had to summarize the book into a few succient points it would be:<br/>* Don't let you child dictate your life<br/>* Let your child wait from an early age<br/>* Your child is capable of reasoning and morality at a very early age<br/>* Be consistent and authoritative not dictatorship<br/><br/>Reminds me a lot of [b:Active Parenting Now|1343214|Active Parenting Now  For Parents of Children Ages 5 to 12|Michael H. Popkin|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348008401s/1343214.jpg|1332807] but told in a conversational way.<br/><br/>Also by the end of the book I bought a baguette and was disappointed to find out it's just bread.
