### My Review
Great 'every-person' book approach to the psychology of Willpower. I liked this book better than [b:Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength|11104933|Willpower  Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength|Roy F. Baumeister|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347857263l/11104933._SY75_.jpg|16027103] even though this book directly quotes [a:Roy F. Baumeister|132685|Roy F. Baumeister|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1345193348p2/132685.jpg]. This book has helpful end of chapter summaries and includes activities to help boost your desired outcomes.<br/><br/>Split into the "I will" and the "I want" and the "I won't" this book helped me understand all the ways to prepare for success when self-control is involved.
