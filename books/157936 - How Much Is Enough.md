### My Review
A collection of easily digested chapters that help hone in on any problem your facing as a parent.<br/><br/>Ask the following questions when deciding on an action for your kids:<br/>1. Is it good for the child's development?<br/>2. Is it within the families resources?<br/>3. Does it harm others?<br/><br/>Bottom line we live in a culture and age of abundance. You will always feel as if you're saying "no" more than "yes".
