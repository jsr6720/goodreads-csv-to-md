### My Review
Skip to the action steps to focus on what concrete steps you can take. However be warned the authors put forward lots of “actions” that preclude research on your behalf. <br/><br/>“Learn a skill” doesn’t just make you marketable. <br/>“Network” won’t drop opportunities in your path.<br/><br/>Short version: always be studying and learning. It's hard to take the advice of 'the winner' who's outcome worked. IE. A lottery winner could hold a seminar saying "buy lottery tickets it works for me". [a:Reid Hoffman|5039437|Reid Hoffman|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1321306394p2/5039437.jpg] "The Alliance" is a much better book encompassing the lessons in this book.
