### My Review
If you ever wonder what the Thief of Baghdad, or "That Lady Hamilton" had to do with WWII and the British defeat at Dunkirk look no further than this book.<br/><br/>Michael Korda weaves his personal narrative of 6-7 years old into the saga of WWII. Warning he comes from a pampered rich background and acknowledges this in the book. Not many boys had full time nannies and trans-Atlantic flights in the 40's.<br/><br/>Great book that covers the events leading up to the evacuation of Dunkirk including how both sides reacted to getting the British forces off the main continent.
