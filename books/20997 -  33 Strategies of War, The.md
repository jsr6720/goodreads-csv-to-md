### My Review
After reading "48 Laws of Power" [a:Robert Greene|865|Robert Greene|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1298212921p2/865.jpg] I picked up this book. Follows the same format as the former, but I didn't find it as compelling. The psychology of humans being more interesting than the tactics of battle.
