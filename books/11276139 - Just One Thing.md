### My Review
Great volume that's worth a read and re-read. Focus in on the things to approach happiness by Letting Go and appreciating all the wonderful things in life.<br/><br/>While our neurons and evolution have wired us to see the negative in life. This makes for poor mental health. Focus on the positives and reduce stress.
