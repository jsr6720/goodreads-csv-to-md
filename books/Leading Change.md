### My Review
This is a comprehensive blueprint for leading change in an organization. It details the difference between being a manager and being a leader. One is title based, anyone can be a leader. Communication underpins all of the phases to changes, and it can take years to establish a measurable culture shift.<br/><br/>Great book for anyone who is responsible for leading change at any level of the organization.
