### My Review
This was a lighter version of the [b:The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less|181206|The 80/20 Principle  The Secret to Achieving More with Less|Richard Koch|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1437557431s/181206.jpg|175093] and focuses on finding the things that you love and pursuing them. At only 130 some-odd pages a great read.<br/><br/>Geared for helping any individual achieve what they desire from life. A very casual read.
