### My Review
Three aspects of building ling term relationships:<br/>1. Define the terms of employment engagement: rotational, instructional, foundational<br/><br/>These three build longer and closer strategic relationships between the employee and employer. <br/><br/>2. Network outside the company for market intelligence. This includes funding meet ups across industry. <br/><br/>3. Fund and build an alumni network to encourage the flow of information back to the company and to welcome returning high performers for another engagement.<br/><br/>I think this was better than "The startup of you" by the same author. That book's points were neatly captured in this book. This book was all about building networks (using LinkedIn of course) to better your organizations reach. A must-read for HR professionals in my opinion. <br/><br/>Some good ideas I loved: encourage employees to network and lunch outside the company. LinkedIn allows you to expense these lunches if you provide a brief on the 'competition'. Start an alumni network (McKinsey firm is notorious about this). Great people leave for bigger and better opportunities but they can provide value to their starter bases. Another good idea was to engage a workforce "one project/stint" at a time. Don't talk about family, everyone know that's not genuine. Don't talk about short term. Engage employees at 1-2 yearly stints, then pull them into the fold at 3-5 years and then promote them as senior leaders. None of these have to be concurrent. IE Employee may switch companies between years 7-12 for another role.
