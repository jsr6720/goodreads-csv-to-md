### My Review
Long. Detailed. History of Exxon mobile from its birth out of the standard oil breakup. This book covers the key players including brief Secretary of State Rex tillerson. <br/><br/>At 18 cds broke this into two readings but covers the entire globe. Almost a collection of short stories based on location.
