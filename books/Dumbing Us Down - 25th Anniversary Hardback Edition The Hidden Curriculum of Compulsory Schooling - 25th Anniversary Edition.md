### My Review
I agree that the systematic application of universal standards regresses everyone to a lower common denominator. But what I disagree with is the application of free market to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Free Market assumes no friction to changing schools and that everyone can migrate to the 'top' performing schools. How could this bear out? Private schools and boarding schools are the epitome of free market schooling and yet they are out of reach of all but the richest Americans.<br/><br/>I also think that this 'community' driven model is dangerous as it could result in cultures like North Korea and other isolated groups where free access to information is not permitted.<br/><br/>The lectures within raise valid points, but there lacks a solution.
