### My Review
One thing I love about [a:David McCullough|6281688|David McCullough|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1429921568p2/6281688.jpg] is his novels ability to weave a full picture of 3 generations around the principle figure. The only negative thing I can bring to say about this book is even abridged it's a snap shot of Theodore's life.<br/><br/>Coming off [b:The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey|78508|The River of Doubt  Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey|Candice Millard|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430014768s/78508.jpg|980007] and [b:The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism|17334495|The Bully Pulpit  Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism|Doris Kearns Goodwin|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386557352s/17334495.jpg|24066037] this book provided a lot of background of the Roosevelt family.
