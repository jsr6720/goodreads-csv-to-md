### My Review
Great collection of “ways of the warrior”. Since the book covers a period of time when much of Japan is peaceful very little is mentioned on strategy and war. <br/><br/>The book reads much like A wise mature self help book full of life lessons. Reading more than once if you too consider the way of the warrior.
