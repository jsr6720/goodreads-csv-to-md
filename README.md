## Content License

/LICENSE/ Covers all written content that was previuosly available on my public [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) account. The /goodreads-export.csv/ was generated from [Account Settings Page](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-get-a-copy-of-my-data-from-Goodreads)

/CODE-LICENSE/ Covers the code within this repo. But it was written with heavy help from ChatGPT 3.5 and GitHub Copilot. Especially since I initailly wrote it in python a language I'm familiar with, but decided to try it as a ruby task since LLMs make it trivial to port small scripts.
