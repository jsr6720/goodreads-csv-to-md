## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: Great book on the history of Harry S Truman. <br/><br/>Most significant achievement was not allowing McCarthy drag the US into WWIII with China during the Korean conflict. Also was commended for his absolute integrity from the very beginning. <br/><br/>Won elections shaking one hand at a time over thousands of miles.
