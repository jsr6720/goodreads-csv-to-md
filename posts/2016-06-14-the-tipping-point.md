## My Review 3/5

Detect Thoughts: A better book than the similar [b:Freakonomics|1202|Freakonomics  A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)|Steven D. Levitt|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1327909092s/1202.jpg|5397] or how do great changes in society follow a viral model of spreading and disbursement.<br/><br/>Social epidemics spread by connectors, mavens, and salespersons. This web of people is how information goes from niche to mainstream. Solid book. Good examples.<br/><br/>Super connectors - many connections to a world over. Think barber, or postman<br/>Mavens - collect specific information. Think the guy who always seems to know the latest restaurant opening<br/>Salesperson - sell new ideas to people<br/><br/>The law of the few (80/20 rule). Stickiness factor, something has to 'stick' for it to cause change. Power of context shows that humans are much more influenced by contex than by self autonomy
