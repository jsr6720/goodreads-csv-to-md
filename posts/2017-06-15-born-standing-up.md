## My Review 3/5

Fun book that covers mainly growing up and a few decades 60-70s. Careful not to get whiplash from the frequent time leaps.<br/><br/>Came away feeling like I learned more about Martin's sexual encounters than his comedy routines. What is the secret to success? Like [Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1439) asserts, practice. Decades and thousands of hours of practice. Martin spent full days for years practicing his work. Constantly refining and adding/removing bits.<br/><br/>I did like how he looked outward to find all those who helped him along the way and thank them.
