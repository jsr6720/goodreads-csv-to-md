Bookshelves

Exclusive: read

Bookshelves: personal-development

Binding/Format: Hardcover

## My Review 2/5

Meh. A little too strong on the manifesting and lacks grit.<br/><br/>While its true that a positive attitude can improve things this book's fable lacks the punch of Patrick Lencioni and the tenacity of actual changes.<br/><br/>If you skip this book, the one good advice it has is identify your vision statement and focus on making it reality.
