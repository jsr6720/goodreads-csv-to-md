My Thoughts: A collection of stories that evaluates the premise that all disadvantages don't also come with advantages.<br/><br/>Starting with David and Goliath Gladwell examines human's inability to grasp an inverted U curve. How too much of a good thing can cease to yield returns and actually travel back down the effective curve.
