## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: Gather round for a story of riches lost and won. Not sure why the average is ~3 this is a great narrative that tackles history and future. Granted, I'm from Texas, Read [b:Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power|13372977|Private Empire  ExxonMobil and American Power|Steve Coll|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347962291l/13372977._SY75_.jpg|18602460], and Pickens reminds me of my own Grandfather.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary, just make sure it's a clean burning natural gas transportation vehicle.
