Exclusive: read

Bookshelves: biography, history, leadership

## My Review 5/5

While it must be tough to separate the story of the Rough Riders from such a large figure in american history (Roosevelt). This book does a good job staying in the narrative of the Rough Riders formation, voyage and fighting spirit.
