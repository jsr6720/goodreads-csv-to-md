<!-- highly dependent on how you personally use jekyll templates, and how you want this to show up -->

## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: Quick read with lots of actions to take at the end of each chapter. Nice collection of key manager concepts and their online implications. <br/><br/>If you read nothing else. Buy a high quality web cam.
