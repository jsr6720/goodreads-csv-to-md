## My Review 4/5

**Abridged version of the book**<br/><br/>So picking this book up I hoped to learn a lot more about muckrakers and Roosevelt. Honestly though I felt the narrative focused too much on Roosevelt's accomplishments and life at the expense of a full history of investigative journalism.<br/><br/>Granted the one chapter about McClure's magazine was insightful but much of the book focused on the larger than life personality of Roosevelt. I did learn about Taft as well, but again while [b:Team of Rivals|2199|Team of Rivals  The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln|Doris Kearns Goodwin|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347278868s/2199.jpg|2861004] had a much better narrative around Lincoln and Seward this book failed to convince me of Taft's and Roosevelt's friendship until the epilogue.<br/><br/>Still a good book, but reads more as a historical coverage not focused on journalism.
