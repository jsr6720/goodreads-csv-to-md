## My Review 3/5

### Date Read

### Date Added

My Thoughts: Good. Actually quite sad towards the end on account of detail description of death and loss of life.<br/>The twin story telling of Isaac's life and the storm build up was confusing.<br/><br/>Should review basic Texas geography before listening.<br/>Sparked an interest in the weather bureau though...
