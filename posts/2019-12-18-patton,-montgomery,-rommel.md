My Thoughts: Hard to summarize three great generals into one book. This one seems to do everyone justice. Coming away with a better appreciation for the commanders to fought the wars.<br/><br/>Check out the epilogue for summarized leadership lessons. Specifically in the will to fight and the means to fight.
