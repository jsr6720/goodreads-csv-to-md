## My Review 1/5

Detect Thoughts: Didn't finish. Book was a collection of anecdotes about his personal life, uninteresting, and previous hunter's lives which barely scratched the surface of their rich history.<br/><br/>Moral: people who spend time outdoors are more 'rugged' than those who spend time indoors.
