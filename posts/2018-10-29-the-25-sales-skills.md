## My Review 3/5

Quick top hitting inter-personal things to watch for while making sales relationships.<br/>Emphasizes that even in today's ultra electronic world it's still 'know your customer' and build a relationship of solving problems.<br/><br/>Best tip I liked was "be righted". Make small mistakes in front of prospects to be corrected and gain valuable information while allowing the prospect a chance to feel superior.
