## My Review 4/5

Good book that covers the years leading up to President Lincolns assassination. Though the title led me to believe this book would be more about cabinet decisions it was ultimately a discussion of how Lincoln balanced the various egos and political ambitions of those in his cabinet.<br/><br/>I wish it had spent a little more time on how the cabinet fared after the death of Lincoln. Still a good book.
