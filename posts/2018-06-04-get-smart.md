## My Review 3/5

An updated but not as impact-ful version of [b:Think and Grow Rich|30186948|Think and Grow Rich|Napoleon Hill|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463241782s/30186948.jpg|1199320]. essentially banish the bad habits and replace with strong self-thought and wealth accumulating actions.
