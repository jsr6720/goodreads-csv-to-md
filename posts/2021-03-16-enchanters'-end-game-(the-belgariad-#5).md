Exclusive: read

Bookshelves: fantasy, childhood-favorite

## My Review 5/5

Picked this up from my childhood pile to give it a reread. I found all my favorite characters. One thing I do wish I could un-see though is all the similarities to other works of fiction in the same time period. All and all a great trip back in time.
