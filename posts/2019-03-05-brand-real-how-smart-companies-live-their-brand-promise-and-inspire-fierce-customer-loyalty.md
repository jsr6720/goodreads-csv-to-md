My Thoughts: Great overview of what it means to have a "brand" and how consumers interact with that brand.<br/><br/>A brand invokes a promise in consumers head and it builds equity when the experience exceeds the expectations of the consumer.<br/><br/>The best brands build an authentic character and lives out it's promise with its constituents. Chasing buzz-words or personality traits is a surefire way to misunderstand what it is to "brand" a product.
