<!-- highly dependent on how you personally use jekyll templates, and how you want this to show up -->

## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: Abridged. Biggest let down was Hamilton's short life. Very good.<br/>Hamilton's role in a central bank and unifying the states into a strong nation was enlightening.
