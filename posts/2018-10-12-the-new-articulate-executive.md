## My Review 4/5

A quick read and chapters are separated by section. IE 'presenting on TV' or 'Use of teleprompters'.<br/><br/>Key takeaways for me:<br/>* No lecture/presentation can go past 18 minutes without re-engaging the audience<br/>* Start with the summary and projections forward, work down to the details<br/>* Present a thin, streamlined power point (wafer) and provide documentation after (whopper)<br/><br/>Only 3 bullet points because apparently humans like odd numbers.
