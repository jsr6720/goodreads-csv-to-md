My Thoughts: I want to give the beneifit of the doubt since this is an abridged recording, however I felt that [b:Boundaries with Kids|104887|Boundaries with Kids  When to Say Yes, When to Say No to Help Your Children Gain Control of Their Lives|Henry Cloud|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1453843517s/104887.jpg|1393909] and [b:Active Parenting Now|1343214|Active Parenting Now  For Parents of Children Ages 5 to 12|Michael H. Popkin|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348008401s/1343214.jpg|1332807] are far superior choices to this book.<br/><br/>In short here are three lessons when dealing with primarily toddler and early elementary school aged children:<br/><br/>* Don't dismiss feelings<br/>* Have the kid be an active participant in their world<br/>* As better described in the boundaries book above. Allow kids to experience natural consequences over punishment.<br/>
