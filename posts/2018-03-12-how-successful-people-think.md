## My Review 3/5

Detect Thoughts: Solid book on the practices of thinking by successful people. Number one lesson to take away is that great achievers put forethought into their plans.<br/><br/>Maxwell has great leadership books. I missed that this was excerpted from a larger work and it shows. It's a reflection on different though habits and how best to match your personality to a specific habit. Things like, set a routine, or be prepared. Moving on to his much more acclaimed "5 Levels of Leadership" book
