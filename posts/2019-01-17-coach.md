## My Review 4/5

Proposed title change: "Back in my day..."<br/><br/>This book is a quick summary of how a coach who challenged his players in the past has lost out to the "curling" parents who try to smooth over every interaction little Bobby has and safeguard his eternal transcript to get into Harvard.<br/><br/>Great read.
