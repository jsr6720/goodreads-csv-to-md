## My Review 4/5

This book is a look at the ways emerging companies can expand their reach to 'breakthrough' the next level. Unfortunately I came away feeling that "big bets" were the cornerstone of this approach. Just as a poker player can go all in and double his chips so too can companies risk everything on something new. However at risk is the very company and as such I much preferred [b:Blue Ocean Strategy|4898|Blue Ocean Strategy  How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant|W. Chan Kim|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416445924l/4898._SX50_.jpg|1848380] as a mechanism for identifying the next strategic focus.<br/><br/>Frankly. I rated this book a 4/5 instead of 3/5 because the narrative reminded me of [b:Business Adventures|4191136|Business Adventures|John Brooks|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405094011l/4191136._SY75_.jpg|4238490] and was a fun listen. Two of the firms were of particular interest to me: Paychex and Intuit. There are variety of concepts that are good to remember, listed below.<br/><br/>Quarterly strategy "advance" meetings - bring in all levels of the organization to get a fuller picture of your strategy. Don't just set it and forget it. Must be followed with action and accountability.<br/><br/>Crown the company - great leaders know the vision is bigger than the person. Making a company a place where employees WANT to work is far more important than fiefdoms.<br/><br/>Build the culture - building a company that outlast a visionary is key. This has been covered in more depth with [b:Built to Last|4122|Built to Last  Successful Habits of Visionary Companies|James C. Collins|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412047084l/4122._SY75_.jpg|147916]<br/><br/>Place big bets - The key to capturing more revenue is placing layering bets. However as noted above. I think Blue Ocean Strategy explains better this effect.<br/><br/>Grooming 'in'-sultants - don't disregard the voices of the internal debate<br/><br/>Loyalty vs Liability - as the firm grows make sure your people receive the necessary training to succeed in this new environment. Remember being loyal to an employee can hamper the growth of an organization.
