## My Review 4/5

Actually the "mother" from [Death by Meeting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49040) this was a better written fable I thought. <br/><br/>Absence of trust—unwilling to be vulnerable within the group<br/>Fear of conflict—seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate<br/>Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization<br/>Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards<br/>Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success<br/><br/>As with death by meeting, crucial that leaders show vulnerabilities and engage in team building excercise. Also team should be < 5-8 people at the most.
