## My Review 4/5

Actually the "mother" from [b:Death by Meeting|49040|Death by Meeting  A Leadership Fable...about Solving the Most Painful Problem in Business|Patrick Lencioni|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348784131s/49040.jpg|47976] this was a better written fable I thought. <br/><br/>Absence of trust—unwilling to be vulnerable within the group<br/>Fear of conflict—seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate<br/>Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization<br/>Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards<br/>Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success<br/><br/>As with death by meeting, crucial that leaders show vulnerabilities and engage in team building excercise. Also team should be < 5-8 people at the most.
