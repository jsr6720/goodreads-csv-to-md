## My Review 3/5

Detect Thoughts: First half of the book is great. Digresses in the second half. Very blunt language that is fortunately backed by science. Probably a few too many references to the author's sex life, but I'm guess he doesn't give a fuck about that.<br/><br/>Much preferred [b:The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less|181206|The 80/20 Principle  The Secret to Achieving More with Less|Richard Koch|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437557431s/181206.jpg|175093] because the crutch of this book is 'find the few things that give you the most sustained happiness'. Pursue that over escalating dopamine hits. Definitely a book that ignores reality of systemic elevation of white young men in the technology industries.
