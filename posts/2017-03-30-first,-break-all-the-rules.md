My Thoughts: Great book that challenges many of the assumptions about managing people.<br/><br/>Greatest contribution is the list of questions that guide great performers.<br/>Do I know what is expected of me at work?<br/>Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right? <br/>Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best everyday? <br/>... Many more<br/><br/>Remember that "average" is a long way off from a cluster of high-performers. Focusing on innate talent and train skills is the best way to accomplish great staff.
