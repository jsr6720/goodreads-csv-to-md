## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: An update to the original. I found that maxwell still has a great message. But I liked the first edition better. <br/><br/>In a nutshell. Always be growing. Always be learning. <br/><br/>Nothing meaningful or worthwhile happens by accident. Those journeys are always uphill.
