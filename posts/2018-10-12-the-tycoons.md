## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: First. This is not not a biography of the four tycoons as much as it is a trawling history from the end of the Civil War through the early 1900s.<br/><br/>However there are many lessons in the boom/bust cycle of frothy investing that are playing out again today with technology firms.<br/><br/>A great read that goes several manager structures deeper than just the figureheads and how that impacted the everyday man. Just be prepared for chapters of context that are skim-able.
