## My Review 4/5

Fun book. Most chapters start with a quote from Shakespeare. Focuses on blending the lessons of [b:Thinking, Fast and Slow|11468377|Thinking, Fast and Slow|Daniel Kahneman|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1317793965s/11468377.jpg|16402639] with [b:Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)|522525|Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)  Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts|Carol Tavris|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1328876733s/522525.jpg|2171014].<br/><br/>Definitely skips over many of the finer points of the published literature. Through personal perception and cognitive biases, people imagine the future poorly, in particular what will make them happy.<br/><br/>Key point, the body has a psychological immune system that helps the person feel better once it's tripped. It's why you suffer in a bad job, but feel great when you're laid off.<br/><br/>[wiki citation]<br/>Imagination tends to add and remove details, but people do not realize that key details may be fabricated or missing from the imagined scenario.<br/>Imagined futures (and pasts) are more like the present than they actually will be (or were).<br/>Imagination fails to realize that things will feel different once they actually happenâ€”most notably, the psychological immune system will make bad things feel not so bad as they are imagined to feel.
