My Thoughts: This is a great read. On par as an shorter version of [b:Think and Grow Rich|30186948|Think and Grow Rich|Napoleon Hill|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463241782s/30186948.jpg|1199320]. Far too much to retain in one reading here are some key points:<br/><br/>* Always have a beginner's mindset<br/>* Stay curious to the world around you<br/>* Never stop growing<br/>* Life begins at the edge of our comfort zone
