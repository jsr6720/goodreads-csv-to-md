## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: This is an incredibly long book that can be summarized in a few points:<br/>* Collect data to make data-based decisions<br/>* Watch out for the narrative fallacy<br/>* Build a culture of learning from mistakes<br/><br/>If you've read [b:Good to Great|76865|Good to Great  Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't|James C. Collins|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546097703l/76865._SY75_.jpg|1094028] or [b:Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)|522525|Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)  Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts|Carol Tavris|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328876733l/522525._SX50_.jpg|2171014] or [b:Thinking, Fast and Slow|11468377|Thinking, Fast and Slow|Daniel Kahneman|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317793965l/11468377._SX50_.jpg|16402639] you've been exposed to a lot of the stories and anecdotes of this book.<br/><br/>Other key concepts include cognitive dissonance, fundamental attribution error and breaking ambitions goals into discrete measurable chunks.<br/><br/>All in all, a good book.
