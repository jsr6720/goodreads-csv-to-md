## My Review 2/5

Detect Thoughts: Entire book can be summarized: You cannot parent effectively unless you are calm. Look to the environment for stressors, you must wait for a teachable moment to teach a lesson.<br/><br/>There is a LOT of science here, but nothing directly applicable. Far superior books were [b:The Collapse of Parenting|25273812|The Collapse of Parenting  How We Hurt Our Kids When We Treat Them Like Grown-Ups|Leonard Sax|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435189862s/25273812.jpg|45000079] or [b:Boundaries with Kids|104887|Boundaries with Kids  When to Say Yes, When to Say No to Help Your Children Gain Control of Their Lives|Henry Cloud|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1453843517s/104887.jpg|1393909]
