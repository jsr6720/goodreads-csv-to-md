## My Review 2/5

This book is a lot of yelling and not much substance.<br/><br/>See things like [book:Blue Ocean Strategy|4898] for a discussion on how dominating a sector is important.<br/><br/>See [book:The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People|36072] for how to be a better person.<br/><br/>See [author:James C. Collins|2826] for the flywheel concept.<br/><br/>It's hard to listen to a guy tell you that he would be more successful if he didn't' violate his own 10x rule. This author is not for me.
