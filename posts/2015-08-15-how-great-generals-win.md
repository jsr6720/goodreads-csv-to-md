<!-- highly dependent on how you personally use jekyll templates, and how you want this to show up -->

## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: Barred from a 4 based on it's overly dry approach to battle movements. Most interesting part of the book was footnotes on the evolution of battle and war technology. Would recommend to the right person.
