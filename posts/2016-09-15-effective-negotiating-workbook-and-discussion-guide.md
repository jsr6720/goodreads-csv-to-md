My Thoughts: Picked this up at a library sale. It's ok.. The participants are not on microphone so it's hard to hear some of the questions. The author and presenter cover many negotiating tactics but I ended feeling a little uneasy in the knowledge gained.<br/><br/>I know the point of the workshop is to cover the forms of negotiation tactics, but some of them seem more like ethically poor suggestions instead of pitfall avoidance.<br/><br/>For example. As a seller is it ethical to research when your buyer has purchased plane tickets for? Surely you know that as deadlines approach leverage can be applied 'to get it over with', but not so sure on this point.<br/><br/>Or how about this: is it ethical to ask a seller how they are paid (on commission)? Is it ethical to say "let's go off the record" and conclude negotiations on a golf course or in a restaurant?
