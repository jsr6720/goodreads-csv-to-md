<!-- highly dependent on how you personally use jekyll templates, and how you want this to show up -->

## My Review 3/5

Detect Thoughts: Workshop series, poor format for audio book. Got some cool worksheets out of the deal.<br/>Focus on the Wildly Important Goals (WIGs) to successfully convert lofty goals into concrete actions.<br/><br/>Only the introduction is by Covey so that was a bit of a let down.
