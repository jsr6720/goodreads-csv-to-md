## My Review 5/5

Detect Thoughts: Another fantastic portrait of American success story the Wright Brothers by McCullough.<br/><br/>Much like Michael Collins who orbited the moon, the unsung hero of this book is Charlie Taylor, the mechanic who ran the bike shop and provided the mechanical engine to power the first planes.<br/><br/>A classic "overnight success" traced through the 10 years leading up to it.
