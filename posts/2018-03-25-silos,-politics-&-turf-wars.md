## My Review 3/5

I don't like fables that are longer than Aesop. But I make an exception for Lencioni. Key takeaway: management needs to tackle projects as a team. And an organization of silos is a direct reflection of the leadership style of the executive team. If budgets and resources and allocations are all "us vs them" at the top. It reflects itself to the bottom
