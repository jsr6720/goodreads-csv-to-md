## My Review 4/5

Detect Thoughts: This book does not focus on strategic initiatives. It is a study of the history of mankind and how it's anthropology can be used with managing people.<br/><br/>Partly [b:A Brief History of Mankind|6567068|A Brief History of Mankind|Cyril Aydon|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348472665s/6567068.jpg|6760016] and [b:Thinking, Fast and Slow|11468377|Thinking, Fast and Slow|Daniel Kahneman|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1317793965s/11468377.jpg|16402639] Sinek makes the case that only by understanding how humans react physiologically to situations can we lead them.<br/><br/>If I had no background in mental models this would've been a 5/5. This book tries a bit hard to be everything to everyone. It has a deep history of how humans behave anthropologically and how to best serve a leadership position to the group. Key take-away. Better to be the servant and perform favors than to be the tyrant and demand action. This was a good book and my summary doesn't do it justice. Also added to my list by the same author [b:Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action|7108725|Start with Why  How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action|Simon Sinek|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360936414s/7108725.jpg|7367737]
