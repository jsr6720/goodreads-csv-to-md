## My Review 5/5

Amazing book and really shows the foundational thinking of Collins future work. I liked this right up there with Andy Groves book [b:High Output Management|324750|High Output Management|Andrew S. Grove|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347800461l/324750._SY75_.jpg|315440] and [b:First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently|50937|First, Break All the Rules  What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently|Marcus Buckingham|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442357545l/50937._SY75_.jpg|49725].<br/><br/>This books focuses on companies that are past seed stage, but not quite past 5 years. It is also a fantastic blueprint for brining innovation sectors back into established companies.
