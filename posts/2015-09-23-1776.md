## My Review 3/5

Detect Thoughts: Picked up another David McCullough book after reading [b:John Adams|2203|John Adams|David McCullough|https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1327953700s/2203.jpg|963375]. This one was narrated by him and a bit more dry. His story-telling narrative doesn't work as well when not following one 'protagonist'.<br/><br/>It's also quite lengthy for only covering one year of history. I enjoyed better "The American revolution" by Guelzo, Allen C
